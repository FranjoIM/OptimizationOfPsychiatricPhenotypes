# [PAPER] Optimization of Psychiatric Phenotypes for Genetic Analyses in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study

**Objective**. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study is a longitudinal study of US adolescents with a wide breadth of psychiatric, neuroimaging, and genetic data that can be leveraged to better understand psychiatric diseases. The reliability of the psychiatric data collected has not yet been examined. This study aims to explore and optimize the reliability/validity of psychiatric diagnostic constructs in the ABCD study.

**Method**. Parent-and-child-reported psychiatric data for 11,876 children (aged 9.5Â±0.5 at first assessment) were examined over 4 years to derive specific constructs for psychiatric diagnoses using longitudinal information. Rates of psychiatric disorders were calculated and compared to those reported in the epidemiological literature.

**Results**. The rates of self-reported psychiatric disorders at any single time point (broad diagnostic construct) were higher than indicated by epidemiological studies. Narrow diagnostic constructs, which required the endorsement of psychiatric disorders at a majority of longitudinal assessments, demonstrated a better rate approximation of literature-reported prevalences for most disorders (e.g., the prevalence of broad OCD was 13.3% compared to narrow at 2.6% and literature-reported at 2.3%). Analysis of comorbidity, using OCD as an example diagnosis, also showed a better approximation of literature-reported comorbidity rates using the narrow construct, with some exceptions. 

**Conclusion**. We conclude that the self-report-based K-SADS is reasonably good at assessing child psychopathology in the ABCD Study, particularly when longitudinal data are leveraged, but should be accompanied by more in-depth assessments or clinician-administered K-SADS if using data where accurate disorder classifications are paramount.
